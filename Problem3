Question:
Given a string s, you need to slice it so that the output is a substring that contains all the characters except the first and last.
Note: The length of the s will be greater than 2. 

Examples:

Input: s = "Hello"
Output: ell
Explanation: The first and last character are ignored.
Input: s = "World"
Output: orl
Explanation: The first and last characters are ignored.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public static String sliceString(String s) {
        // code here
        return s.substring(1, s.length() - 1);
    }
}
